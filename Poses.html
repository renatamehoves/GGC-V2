<h2>A Guide through your Wedding Poses</h2>


<div>


<p>
If you’ve never done a full-blown editorial shoot or even tried your hand at modelling, 
posing for your wedding photos can feel awkward. 

Now, we’re not saying you need to go through some America’s Next Top Model style boot 
camp or hire a professional to help you get your look just right, but you probably want
to familiarize yourself with some key wedding photo poses before your big day arrives. 
They’re simple, they’re stunning and anyone can do them.
Here are the essential wedding poses to try.</p>


<h3 >The handhold</h3>
<p>This tried-and-true wedding pose is sweet and simple, but definitely won’t disappoint. 
  Create a little space between you and your partner (I know, this is tough, especially on 
  your wedding day) and grasp each other’s hands. 
  You’ll want to ask us to stand a bit farther away so we can get your entire ensemble, 
  from head-to-toe, in the shot.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (48).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The stroll</h3>
<p>Take your partner’s hand and go on a little walking tour of your venue while your 
  photographer works their magic. Soundtrack suggestion: “Where You Lead” by Carole King.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (105).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The walk away</h3>
<p>Are the backs of your ensembles just as pretty as the fronts? 
  Ask your photographer to capture that magic by following you as you walk away. 
  You can hold hands, strut side-by-side or even dance it out for something a 
  little different.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (43).jpg" alt="">


<h3 >The ring shot</h3>
<p>Yes, you’ll want plenty of pics of your smiling faces but, let’s be honest, you also want 
  a money shot of your gorgeous new ring. Pose in a way that showcases your 
  new bauble, like placing your left hand on the back of your partner’s head or on their 
  shoulder. Alternatively, if you want to get both of your rings, you can lightly layer 
  your hands-on top of one another. You’ll want some faraway shots and some close-ups for
  your album.</p>

<h3 >The lift</h3>
<p>As we learned from Dirty Dancing, everybody loves a lift. 
  Get a full-body shot of your partner hoisting you up into the air. 
  Don’t worry – while it’d be impressive, it doesn’t need to be a full 
  overhead lift for it to look totally magical on film.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (93).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The dip</h3>
<p>This is another dance move-inspired pose that always looks great. 
  Ask your partner to dip you like they would on the dance floor for a 
  romantic full-body shot.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (69).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The classic kiss</h3>
<p>Obviously, your wedding album is gonna require a smooching shot. 
  Ask your photographer for a variety of options, including close-ups 
  and full-body options. Let’s face it, you’re going to be making out a lot 
  on your wedding day, so getting these pics won’t be too tough.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (68).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The sitting pretty</h3>
<p>Got a cute bench at your venue? Is there a cool storefront you and your 
  partner can cozy up in front of? Is there a booth the two of you can grab? 
  Take a seat and let your photographer do the rest.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\20191124-GGC_8010.JPG" alt="">

<h3 >The cheek kiss</h3>
<p>This one’s a little sweeter and more demure than a kiss shot, 
  but still a necessity for any wedding album.</p>
<img class="poses_img"  src="images\gallery\1- (101).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The veil wraps</h3>
<p>If you’re rocking a veil on your wedding day, you’ll want to try this great 
  wedding photography pose. Grab your partner and drape the veil over both of your heads.
  You can smile through the mesh or get another killer kiss picture with a bit of extra oomph.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (36).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The loving look</h3>
<p>This one is far from tricky. Just stare lovingly into your partner’s eyes so that your 
  photographer can capture just how much you love each other. 
  P.S. there will probably be a lot of candids of this, too.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\20190406-GGC_0464.JPG" alt="">

<h3 >The face touches</h3>
<p>Like the loving look, but a little bit different. 
  Adding a light hand on your partner’s face will make the shot even more romantic, 
  so it’s worth trying out, too.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\20190317-GGC_9065.JPG" alt="">

<h3 >The cute cuddle</h3>
<p>Cozy up with your partner’s arm around you for an intimate shot 
  that can be taken almost anywhere.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\20200317-GGC_1513.JPG" alt="">

<h3 >The faux first dance</h3>
<p>Have a first dance before your first dance, preferably at the peak of golden hour. 
  That way you’ll get a cool dancing shot without any accidental photobombers 
  in the background.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (66).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The faraway love</h3>
<p>If you’re working with a cool space, this photo is a must. 
  Stand a few feet away from your partner and give them a cute wink or little laugh. 
  This will show off your playful side and the beauty of your venue all at once.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\20190301-GGC_8090.JPG" alt="">

<h3 >The classic smile</h3>
<p>Just cheese it up for the camera and give your photographer a 
  pair of million-dollar smiles!</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (49).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The almost kiss</h3>
<p>Not quite a kiss, but still pretty darn cute.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (103).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The nose-to-nose</h3>
<p>An Eskimo kiss may just be the sweetest type of kiss there is, 
  especially in a picture.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (110).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The hand kiss</h3>
<p>Act like a true gent and kiss your partner on the hand. 
  This wedding pose looks like a frame from a Disney movie and is worth sampling.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (27).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The forehead-to-forehead</h3>
<p>Share an intimate moment and stand with your foreheads 
  touching and your eyes closed. This looks great close-up and faraway.</p>
<img class="poses_img" src="images\gallery\1- (107).jpg" alt="">

<h3 >The opposite views</h3>
<p>Stand facing opposite directions to give your partner 
  (face-to-face with the photographer) the spotlight without letting them steal the entire show.</p>
